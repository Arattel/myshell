### Some notes about using this app/libraries/etc

From libraries that need installation I included only Boost and Readline. Both of them were 
recommended by O.F., hence I don't see any sense in explaining how to install them. From external libraries 
I used **docopt** sources of which were included.

### Mycat, myls

To make mycat and myls  launchable, you need to use CMake from **/external_programs/mycat/CMakeLists.txt** and 
**/external_programs/myls/CMakeLists.txt**

### This project 

To compile this project, you have to use cmake in main project directory.
